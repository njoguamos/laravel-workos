title: 'PKCE ⚠️'
description: 'The 
Proof Key for Code Exchange
 (PKCE) flow is an extension to the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code flow. It enables public clients, like native apps or single-page apps, to perform the authorization code flow securely. If you are developing a client that makes API calls in public, you’ll need to use this flow.

In this flow, your client generates a code verifier which is a high-entropy cryptographic random string. A code challenge is derived by hashing the code verifier. Instead of using a client secret, provide the code challenge when getting the authorization URL and the code verifier when authenticating a User.'
